sampleimages.mat contain matrices corresponding to 
four images from the coil-20 dataset,
one face image from the Yale Face database,
and the cat image used in the presentation

mocapdata.mat is the motion capture database in matrix form
Columns 25, 26, 37 and 38 in the mocap matrix have extremely small values (~1e-15) compared to the rest of the matrix that never properly converge.
Hence they were not used when simulating mocap data recovery
